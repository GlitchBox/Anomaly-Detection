# Violence Detection
Our objective was to detect violence from surveillance video in real-time. Our work was inspired by this work of anomaly detection from surveillance feed (https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/projects/real-world/). The model was trained on their dataset as well. Our novel contribution would be the utilization of Heirarchical Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). 

**The codebase is inspired by the following repo.**
